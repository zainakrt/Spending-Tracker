# Spending-Tracker

This is a Python-based personal spending tracker that allows users to log their daily spending with associated categories and moods. This tool provides clear summaries of total spendings over various time periods and insights into spending habits based on mood and category. It stores each user's individual data in individual text files for long-term tracking.


## Features 
1. User specific tracking: Each user has a dedicated file to store spending entries.
2. Categorized inputs: Spending enteries are categorized in terms of clothes, makeup, food, etc. This tracker also tells you your most common mood while spending based off of the inputs you have given it, providing further insights to your spending habits.
3. Mood tagging: Users can tag their mood during each entry. For example happy, sad, stressed, etc.
4. Spending summaries: Users are able to easily get calculations of overall spendings over given periods of time such as past week or 30 days.
5. Data management: Users have the option to view, delete individual records, or delete all records.

## How It Works 
1. User login/signup: Users either enter their username if a file for them already exists or if the username they entered does not already exist, a file with the username they entered automatically is created.
2. Following prompts: After the user opens their existing file or has a new file created, they will see a list of numbered options on screen. The user can interact with the program by entering the number corresponding to the action they want to perform. For example:

1: Record new spending

2: View spending summary

3: Delete spending records

4: View all spending entries

5: Exit program

By typing the number of their choice, the user navigates through the programâ€™s features easily and intuitively.
